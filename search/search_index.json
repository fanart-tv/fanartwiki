Other Considerations","text":"<p>Here you will find other information that does not fit neatly into the other categories, but is relevant information for contributors.</p> Point System <p>We have a point system that assigns point values to different types of art, and keeps track of the total amount of points per user.</p> <p>This was always meant to be a way to display the hard work our contributors have put into improving the site. It was never meant to be a competition.</p> <p>Unfortunately some people just can\u2019t help themselves and feel they must \u201cwin\u201d whenever points are involved. This leads to poor quality uploads that actually take away from contributing to the site. First by trying to submit just passable images instead of great images, and it steals the time of our volunteer Moderators. </p> <p>Users thought to be engaging in point hunting will kindly be asked to stop, and may be put on probation or even loose uploading privileges. </p> Voting <p>We also have a Voting/Like system in place so you can show an artist when you really appreciate their submissions. We encourage people to vote and vote often. This will help the best art on the site     to get recognition and will also inspire the artists to continue contributing to the site.</p> <p>As happens with any point system, some people feel they must win at votes. There have been many incidents where single users were found using multiple accounts to inflate the vote counts on their own images. This is a violation of the rules here, and a violation of trust. Artificially inflating votes does nothing to help the site and most of the time hurts the site. Violators will be dealt with     harshly.</p> No Good Source Images <p>We understand that sometimes there just aren\u2019t very good sources to work with to make high quality art that will be accepted here. In those cases you should either get very creative and do your best to re-create the art in higher quality, or upload it to one of the many other fanart sites that don\u2019t moderate. Our goal is not to have an image for every single show/movie/album, but to have a Great Image for every single show/movie/album. </p> <p>It\u2019s also a good thing to remember that just because an image doesn\u2019t work well for our library here, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use it in your own media center.

We get a lot of people who really want to support the site and upload a ton of images with the best intentions but never took the time to really grasp the rules and get all of their images denied, then get discouraged. The point is moderators have to write an explanation for every denied image which can take a huge amount of time, and it\u2019s not fun to tell someone who obviously put in a lot of effort that their work isn\u2019t good enough. Nobody wins and it takes time away from moderating images that should be approved.</p> <p>Not all moderators moderate every image type. Most of the moderators are specialists who moderate the types of images they work on themselves which makes it easier to spot the common mistakes for those types and to keep a consistency among those types.</p> <p>It just takes a lot more time to moderate every single image than most people realize.

This guide is aimed at how to go about doing this properly, as well as tips on how to increase your chance for success.</p> <p>Supporting new image type or media section is not a trivial matter and thus has some requirements that need to be met. 1.For a new media section we need to be able to link to an existing Database so we can properly identify a show/movie/album/game etc.. We do not maintain our own database and only link to existing ones. This means that if there isn\u2019t an existing database we can link to via API, then there is no way we can support it. 2. Opening a new image type/media section will need to be supported by both the fanart community and skin developers. 3. There must be a prior commitment from fanart contributors to supply a minimum of 500 pieces of art. This can be achieved by small commitments from many people to reach the target goal of 500.</p> <p>As you can see, there will be a lot involved to support a new image type/media section. One thing that we\u2019ve found from experience is if there really is a need and the community wants it, they will speak up and it will get done. Some ways you can help this along might seem obvious, but I\u2019ll list a few here for the uninitiated. 1. Get support from the skin developer community. This means soliciting support from the most commonly used media center skin developers to gauge interest. If it\u2019s a good idea, it will sell itself. XBMC is by far the main user of our images so it would be a good idea to start there. You can look at the other big hitters in our blog post showing the top 10 API users of 2013. 2. Get support from the fanart community. Start a thread here explaining exactly what you envision and how it can be supported and used in media centers. If it\u2019s a good idea, it should be no problem getting contributors to give a commitment of a certain number of images to help meet the 500 image quota. 3. Expand the net for your cause. Try also posting in the main forums and blogs of popular media centers to get the word out. Developers (and us as well) will respond to the community if the interest is there. Try to get others to join the discussion and show their support. If you follow these guidelines you should get a good idea whether this is something the community really wants. If it is, then we will be happy to support it. If not, maybe it\u2019s just an idea that needs more time or just doesn\u2019t have an audience wide enough to support it. Either way, once you\u2019ve laid the groundwork, it can always be re-visited.</p>"},{"location":"General/retract%20submission/","title":"How to retract a submission before moderation","text":"<p>You might notice a mistake in your submission and want to replace it before it gets moderated.</p> <p>Follow this guide to remove your own submissions.</p> 1- Dashboard2- My Submissions3- Image Type4- Delete <p>You can use the dashboard link under the gauge logo at the top left of every page.</p> <p></p> <p>Navigate to the proper section on the left menu.

If\u00a0it just can\u2019t be resolved otherwise, then please contact an admin with an unedited copy of any conversations.</p> Do not Evade or Ignore the Rules <p>We try to make the rules very clear and even explain where possible the reasoning for those rules. Deliberately trying to undermine the rules to your own ends is unacceptable and will be treated as such. This includes..</p> <ul> <li>The targeting of other users or mods by reporting their images just to harass or annoy them.</li> <li>Uploading your own image and then reporting the existing image as a duplicate.</li> <li>Consistently uploading bad artwork without ever trying to fix denied images. This implies a complete disregard for\u00a0the time it takes moderators to deny and give advice on the problems with an image. If you are not interested in trying\u00a0for a\u00a0better approval rate, then you are better off submitting your images to an unmoderated site.</li> </ul> Use of Profanity <p>This site is doesn\u2019t claim to be family oriented\u00a0as there are not many children editing artwork for their media centers. That said, the use of profanity isn\u2019t outright prohibited, but you are expected to use it with     discretion. Any use of profanity directed towards the staff or other users can result in an immediate deletion of your account. Keep it light and friendly and you shouldn\u2019t have any problems.</p> No Duplicate Accounts <p>Having more than one account on the site is forbidden. Most often these accounts are used to increase votes or for general mischief. If a user is found to have multiple accounts, they risk being banned and having all of their votes removed as well as the authorship of their submissions. It\u2019s just not fair to the fellow artists and will not be tolerated. </p> <p>There are ways to increase your voting power that does support the site. Becoming a VIP can grant you up to 4 votes per image, AND will help keep the site running in the future.</p> Consequences <p>The last thing we want to spend time doing is dealing with rule breakers. We would rather being making great art or improving the site.</p> <p>We have and will ban users when necessary. This can also mean the loss of all accumulated points, and in some cases the name connected to any artwork the user uploaded.</p> <p>Please just read, understand and follow the rules and we can all get on to better things.</p>"},{"location":"General/staff/","title":"Staff","text":"Name Member Since Position Language Specialty Mod Actions Kode Dec 2010 Founder EN Coding Actions Akovia Oct 2012 Admin EN TV Actions Rouiller Jun 2020 Admin EN / NL / FR Music Actions Shevman Feb 2013 Senior Mod EN / RU TV/Movies Actions Simche Jan 2013 Senior Mod EN / GER All Actions Sramio Oct 2018 Experienced Mod EN / HU All Actions hslansky Oct 2014 Experienced Mod EN TV/Movies Actions Mordred Oct 2012 Experienced Mod EN Music Actions Dropsonde Feb 2017 Moderator EN Music Actions AlamC11 Sep 2018 Moderator EN / ES Music Actions Dhanavarsh Reddy May 2016 Moderator EN Music Actions Ricardo-D Feb 2014 Moderator EN / ES Music Actions Wrathicus Sep 2019 Moderator EN cdArts Actions METALLARO Sep 2017 Moderator IT / EN Music Actions Gustavohdh July 2020 Moderator EN TV/Movies Actions"},{"location":"General/staff/#inactive-staff","title":"Inactive Staff","text":"Name Member Since Position Language Specialty ArieS Oct 2012 Admin EN / FR All leepenny Jan 2011 Senior Mod EN Disc Art AL3X Jun 2015 Moderator EN TV/Movies Esky May 2014 Moderator EN All McVicar June 2015 Moderator EN / DE Music"},{"location":"General/user%20guide/","title":"User Guide","text":"<p>If you are reading this, you most likely care about the artwork in your media center and want full control of it.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got you covered.</p> <p>This guide is aimed as users who are here to download art, but are not considering contribting artwork themselves.</p> <p>Not everyone has the abilities to create artwork and that\u2019s perfectly fine.

It is your responsibility to check\u00a0imdb\u00a0or\u00a0tvdb\u00a0before you upload it.</p> </li> </ul> <p>English is the default language as well as the fallback language in Media Centers, this will ensure the artwork is available to the widest audience possible. When we move to the new site, we will have an option to set a piece of art to multiple languages which will make this rule obsolete, but until then please observe this rule.</p> <p>We really don\u2019t want to swamp our database with a zillion images in every possible language/format that exists. If there is an interest for some art in a language that is not available, it will prompt that user to either create that artwork themselves, or they can use the request system. This way only images that are in demand are getting produced, and we are not filling up our pages with art gathering dust.  </p> <p>Our goal should be to try and fill in or make artwork where there is none. This is much more helpful to the site. One look at our\u00a0Incomplete Section\u00a0should give plenty of opportunities for people who want to produce a lot of art and want to really help the site at the same time.</p> Collection Art <ul> <li>Collection art should reflect characters or elements that were in all the movies.</li> </ul> <p>The idea of collection art is to represent the entire collection, and not just one movie. This can be difficult sometimes but creativity should win out in the end if the effort is there. In the case where the main actor has changed, you could have all the main role actors in the same poster/clearart/banner etc. Or even an element that spans all the movies. Point is, if you make an art with a main character and a villain from a single movie, then that should be used for that movie and not as collection art.</p> Clearart Shadows <ul> <li>Do not crop shadows when unnecessary</li> </ul> <p>As the rules states, you are allowed to crop on the bottom and right sides of an image. When this shouldn\u2019t be done is when there is no need for it. If you are using a full uncropped image for your clearart, then there is no reason to crop the shadows either.

You should always strive to use as much of the canvas as possible. Sometimes this isn\u2019t easy to do depending on the source you are working with, but it usually just means you need to get a little creative. Usually a mod will give you some pointers on how to achieve this if this happens to you.

This way only images that are in demand are getting produced, and we are not filling up our pages with art gathering dust.  </p>"},{"location":"ImageTypes/TV/tvthumb/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"TV Thumbs Templates and Tutorials <ul> <li>Why Your Artwork May Be Denied</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Tutorials/Gimp/tutorial-gimp-clearart/","title":"Gimp ClearArt Tutorial","text":"key value Author Akovia Date: April 2022 Difficulty: Beginner Gimp Version: 2.10.30 Estimated Time: 15 Minutes"},{"location":"Tutorials/Gimp/tutorial-gimp-clearart/#description","title":"Description:","text":"<p>In this tutorial you will learn how to design a basic ClearArt for use in the Movie and TV Show sections.

The key considerations to a successful clearart that will pass moderation are \u2026</p> <ul> <li>Use high quality renders and logos.</li> <li>Use as much of the canvas as possible.</li> <li>Do not crop on the top or the left.</li> </ul> <p>The easiest way to start would be to add any effects or shadows to your render at full size, then size everything down to fit within the ClearArt canvas. Make sure you have your aspect ratio locked when resizing as we do not accept images that have been stretched or squished to fit.</p> <p>In the left image below I prepped my work, then brought it together in the right image.</p> <ol> <li>I have the blank ClearArt canvas I prepared in Step 1.</li> <li>I opened the logo I will be using.</li> <li>This is the render I am using.</li> <li>This layer has the raw render that has already been checked and is ready to be used.</li> <li> <p>This layer is the perspective shadow I added to give the image some depth.</p> <ul> <li> *Adding artistic elements is at user\u2019s discretion.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>This is layer is a composite of the render and the perspective shadow combined.</p> </li> <li> <p>I trimmed the logo and render images using Crop to content to remove any surrounding space. Then I just dragged each image over to my blank clearart canvas for placement. </p> <ul> <li> By trimming the empty space around the images, this will allow you easily place and move the images precisely using Gimp\u2019s Snap to Canvas feature.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>The logo was designed for the site so the size was good enough to use as is. You want to avoid enlarging any images which will decrease the quality.</p> <p>The render was larger than the canvas, so I scaled the layer to make it as large as possible without cropping it. In this case I made it 562px tall. Adding the shadow before resizing made it possible to not worry about the shadow getting cropped.</p> Full-Size Image Link <p> Hover image below to see the pieces put together. </p> Full-Size Image Link <p> \u2026 and the finished ClearArt </p> <p></p> Tip <p>If your skills are not yet up to the level required by the site to create your own renders, you might be able to find a render that\u2019s already been done and is free to use.
