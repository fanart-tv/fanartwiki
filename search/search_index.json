Other Considerations","text":"<p>Here you will find other information that does not fit neatly into the other categories, but is relevant information for contributors.</p> Point System <p>We have a point system that assigns point values to different types of art, and keeps track of the total amount of points per user.</p> <p>This was always meant to be a way to display the hard work our contributors have put into improving the site. It was never meant to be a competition.</p> <p>Unfortunately some people just can\u2019t help themselves and feel they must \u201cwin\u201d whenever points are involved. This leads to poor quality uploads that actually take away from contributing to the site. First by trying to submit just passable images instead of great images, and it steals the time of our volunteer Moderators. </p> <p>Users thought to be engaging in point hunting will kindly be asked to stop, and may be put on probation or even loose uploading privileges. </p> Voting <p>We also have a Voting/Like system in place so you can show an artist when you really appreciate their submissions. We encourage people to vote and vote often. This will help the best art on the site     to get recognition and will also inspire the artists to continue contributing to the site.</p> <p>As happens with any point system, some people feel they must win at votes. There have been many incidents where single users were found using multiple accounts to inflate the vote counts on their own images. This is a violation of the rules here, and a violation of trust. Artificially inflating votes does nothing to help the site and most of the time hurts the site. Violators will be dealt with     harshly.</p> No Good Source Images <p>We understand that sometimes there just aren\u2019t very good sources to work with to make high quality art that will be accepted here. In those cases you should either get very creative and do your best to re-create the art in higher quality, or upload it to one of the many other fanart sites that don\u2019t moderate. Our goal is not to have an image for every single show/movie/album, but to have a Great Image for every single show/movie/album. </p> <p>It\u2019s also a good thing to remember that just because an image doesn\u2019t work well for our library here, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use it in your own media center.

We get a lot of people who really want to support the site and upload a ton of images with the best intentions but never took the time to really grasp the rules and get all of their images denied, then get discouraged. The point is moderators have to write an explanation for every denied image which can take a huge amount of time, and it\u2019s not fun to tell someone who obviously put in a lot of effort that their work isn\u2019t good enough. Nobody wins and it takes time away from moderating images that should be approved.</p> <p>Not all moderators moderate every image type. Most of the moderators are specialists who moderate the types of images they work on themselves which makes it easier to spot the common mistakes for those types and to keep a consistency among those types.</p> <p>It just takes a lot more time to moderate every single image than most people realize.

This guide is aimed at how to go about doing this properly, as well as tips on how to increase your chance for success.</p> <p>Supporting new image type or media section is not a trivial matter and thus has some requirements that need to be met. 1.For a new media section we need to be able to link to an existing Database so we can properly identify a show/movie/album/game etc.. We do not maintain our own database and only link to existing ones. This means that if there isn\u2019t an existing database we can link to via API, then there is no way we can support it. 2. Opening a new image type/media section will need to be supported by both the fanart community and skin developers. 3. There must be a prior commitment from fanart contributors to supply a minimum of 500 pieces of art. This can be achieved by small commitments from many people to reach the target goal of 500.</p> <p>As you can see, there will be a lot involved to support a new image type/media section. One thing that we\u2019ve found from experience is if there really is a need and the community wants it, they will speak up and it will get done. Some ways you can help this along might seem obvious, but I\u2019ll list a few here for the uninitiated. 1. Get support from the skin developer community. This means soliciting support from the most commonly used media center skin developers to gauge interest. If it\u2019s a good idea, it will sell itself. XBMC is by far the main user of our images so it would be a good idea to start there. You can look at the other big hitters in our blog post showing the top 10 API users of 2013. 2. Get support from the fanart community. Start a thread here explaining exactly what you envision and how it can be supported and used in media centers. If it\u2019s a good idea, it should be no problem getting contributors to give a commitment of a certain number of images to help meet the 500 image quota. 3. Expand the net for your cause. Try also posting in the main forums and blogs of popular media centers to get the word out. Developers (and us as well) will respond to the community if the interest is there. Try to get others to join the discussion and show their support. If you follow these guidelines you should get a good idea whether this is something the community really wants. If it is, then we will be happy to support it. If not, maybe it\u2019s just an idea that needs more time or just doesn\u2019t have an audience wide enough to support it. Either way, once you\u2019ve laid the groundwork, it can always be re-visited.</p>"},{"location":"General/retract%20submission/","title":"How to retract a submission before moderation","text":"<p>You might notice a mistake in your submission and want to replace it before it gets moderated.</p> <p>Follow this guide to remove your own submissions.</p> 1- Dashboard2- My Submissions3- Image Type4- Delete <p>You can use the dashboard link under the gauge logo at the top left of every page.</p> <p></p> <p>Navigate to the proper section on the left menu.

Any use of profanity directed towards the staff or other users can result in an immediate deletion of your account. Keep it light and friendly and you shouldn\u2019t have any problems.</p> No Duplicate Accounts <p>Having more than one account on the site is forbidden. Most often these accounts are used to increase votes or for general mischief. If a user is found to have multiple accounts, they risk being banned and having all of their votes removed as well as the authorship of their submissions. It\u2019s just not fair to the fellow artists and will not be tolerated. </p> <p>There are ways to increase your voting power that does support the site.

This can be difficult sometimes but creativity should win out in the end if the effort is there. In the case where the main actor has changed, you could have all the main role actors in the same poster/clearart/banner etc. Or even an element that spans all the movies. Point is, if you make an art with a main character and a villain from a single movie, then that should be used for that movie and not as collection art.</p>"},{"location":"ImageTypes/Movies/moviethumb/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"Movie Thumb Templates and Tutorials <ul> <li>Why Your Artwork May Be Denied</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ImageTypes/Music/4kartistbackground/","title":"Music Artist 4K Background","text":"<p>Overview</p> <ul> <li>Artist Backgrounds are high quality backdrops containing the artist/band</li> <li>Can be used as a background while browsing your music library</li> <li>Can be used as a background slideshow while playing music on a mediacentre</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ImageTypes/Music/4kartistbackground/#rules-synopsis","title":"Rules Synopsis","text":"<ul> <li>Images must be in jpg format sized 3840\u00d72160 pixels.</li> <li>Max filesize of 4 MB</li> <li>Copyright infos need to be added in the Comments when uploading the image.

You want to avoid enlarging any images which will decrease the quality.</p> <p>The render was larger than the canvas, so I scaled the layer to make it as large as possible without cropping it.
